# [TopicName]

[Explainer video or image]

Multiple introductory paragraphs can be used to describe the topic. The first paragraph should be a short summary of the topic. The following paragraphs should provide more detail. Assume no prior knowledge of the topic. The name of the NuGet package which delivers the feature should be mentioned in the first paragraph.

Describe the motivation for the feature. Why is it important? What problem does it solve? So what? Explain all of this without addressing the reader with _you_, _your_, etc. Make initial mentions of potentially unintuitive **feature names** bold to help the reader understand key terms. Ensure that these paragraph(s) are purely descriptive of the concept and do not contain any instructions.

It may be necessary to describe a use case for the feature. Outline the unique scenarios that our Uno.Extensions implementation facilitates. This can be done in a separate paragraph or paragraphs. Again, do not address the reader directly because this is not a how-to.

## Using [TopicName]

Detail with a code snippet how to enable the feature. This should be a short code snippet that can be copied and pasted into a project. The code snippet should be as simple as possible. It should not contain any unnecessary code.

Use ellipses to indicate that the code snippet is not complete.

```csharp
// code here
...
```

Inform the user once the feature is proerly enabled. This can be done in a separate paragraph or code snippet.

## Example Sub-feature topic

Briefly give additional details about a capability offered by [FeatureName].

To use [FeatureName] do the following:  

```csharp
// code here
...
```

Include any preferred approach where needed. For example, when using a feature that is not recommended for Web Assembly (WASM), include a recommended approach that is supported by WASM.

Use inline code formatting for specific method names. For example, use `UseConfiguration()` instead of _UseConfiguration()_.
