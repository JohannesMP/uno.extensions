# Usage in applications of feeds

The recommended use for feeds is only in models.

The Reactive framework allows you to design state-less _models_, focusing on the presentation logic. 
They are expected to expose some `IFeed`, `IListFeed`, `IState` or `IListState`.
A bindable friendly and higly performant _view model_ is then automatically generated by the Reactive framework.
It is this class that will hold the state and which **has to be set as `DataContext` of your page**.

> [!NOTE]
> The _ViewModel_ of a _model_ is created when the class name matches the regex "Model$".
> You can customize that behavior using the `[ImplicitBindables("MyApp\.Presentation\.\.*Model$")]` on the assembly
> or the `[ReactiveBindable]` attribute on you model itself.

> [!NOTE]
> To ease _models_ declaration, public properties are also accessible on the _view model_ class. 
> You can also access the model itself through the `Model` property.

## Display some data in the UI (Model to View)

To render a _feed_ in the UI, you only have to expose it through a public property:
```csharp
public IFeed<Product[]> Products = Feed.Async(_productService.GetProducts);
```

Then in your page, you can add a `FeedView`:
```xml
<Page x:Class="MyProject.MyPage"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns:uer="using:Uno.Extensions.Reactive.UI">

    <uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Products}">
        <DataTemplate>
            <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
        </DataTemplate>
    </uer:FeedView>
```

## Refreshing a data

The `FeedView` exposes a `Refresh` command directly in the data context of its content.
You can use this command to trigger a refresh from the view, like a "pull to refresh".

```xml
<Page x:Class="MyProject.MyPage"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns:uer="using:Uno.Extensions.Reactive.UI">

    <uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Products}">
        <DataTemplate>
            <Grid>
                <Grid.RowDefinitions>
                    <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
                    <RowDefinition />
                <Grid.RowDefinitions>

                <Button Grid.Row="0" 
                        Content="Refresh" 
                        Command="{Binding Refresh}" />
                <ListView Grid.Row="1" 
                          ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
            </Grid>
        </DataTemplate>
    </uer:FeedView>
```

### Refreshing using a RefreshContainer (a.k.a. pull to refresh)

The `RefreshContainer` does not have a `Command` property to which you can data-bind the command exposed by the `FeedView`.
This is because the `RefreshContainer` needs to know when the refresh has completed in order to remove the loading wheel.

However, Uno.Extensions defines the `IAsyncCommand.IsExecuting` property which can be used to track the completion of the refresh.
Uno.Extensions also defines a `RefreshContainerExtensions.Command` attached property which allow to directly data-bind the refresh command 
(or any generated feed command) to the `RefreshContainer`.

```xml
<Page x:Class="MyProject.MyPage"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns:uer="using:Uno.Extensions.Reactive.UI">

    <uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Products}" 
                  RefreshingState="None">
        <DataTemplate>
            <RefreshContainer uer:RefreshContainerExtensions.Command="{Binding Refresh}">
                <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
            </RefreshContainer>
        </DataTemplate>
    </uer:FeedView>
```

> [!TIP]
> When you use a `RefreshContainer` to trigger the refresh of your _feed_, as the `RefreshContainer` do have its own loading indicator,
> you might have 2 loading indicators, one from the `RefreshContainer` itself, and a second one from the `FeedView`.
> In order to avoid that, you should instruct your `FeedView` to not use the loading state in case of refresh by setting `RefreshingState="None"`.

## Pagination

When your source supports pagination (like `ListFeed.Paginated`), you can data-bind the collection exposed by the generated view model to a `ListView` to automatically enable pagination.

```xml
<uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Items}">
    <DataTemplate>
        <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
    </DataTemplate>
</uer:FeedView>
```

The collection exposed for binding by the generated view models also exposes some [extended properties](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.extensions/blob/main/src/Uno.Extensions.Reactive.UI/Presentation/Bindings/Collections/Facets/BindableCollectionExtendedProperties.cs), 
so you can enhance the UX of the pagination, like display a loading indicator while loading the next page.

```xml
<uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Items}">
    <DataTemplate>
        <ListView Grid.Row="1"
                  ItemsSource="{Binding Data}">
            <ListView.Footer>
                <ProgressBar Visibility="{Binding Data.ExtendedProperties.IsLoadingMoreItems}"
                             IsIndeterminate="{Binding Data.ExtendedProperties.IsLoadingMoreItems}"
                             HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" />
            </ListView.Footer>
        </ListView>
    </DataTemplate>
</uer:FeedView>
```

## Selection

The reactive framework has embedded support of selected item of a `ListFeed` data-bound to a `Selector`, like the `ListView`.
It is not required to data-bind (and synchronize) the `ListView.SelectedItem`, it will instead be automatically pushed from and to the view.

```xml
<uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Items}">
    <DataTemplate>
        <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
    </DataTemplate>
</uer:FeedView>
```

And in the model:

```csharp
public IListState<int> Items => ListView
    .Value(this, () => ImmutableList.Create(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
    .Selection(SelectedItem);

public IState<int> SelectedItem => State.Value(this, () => 3);
```

### Project selected item into another entity

It is possible to synchronize the selected item _key_ into another aggregate root object, for instance, assuming `Profile` and `Country` records:

```csharp
public record Profile(string? FirstName, string? CountryId);

public record Country(string Id, string Name);
```

The selected item automatically stored into the `Profile.CountyId` by doing:
```csharp
public IState<Profile> Profile => State.Async(this, _svc.GetProfile);

public IListState<Country> Countries => ListState
    .Async(this, _svc.GetCountries)
    .Selection(Profile, p => p.CountryId);
```

```xml
<uer:FeedView Source="{Binding Countries}">
    <DataTemplate>
        <ComboBox ItemsSource="{Binding Data}" />
    </DataTemplate>
</uer:FeedView>
```

> [!NOTE]
> As the `IState<Porfile> Profile` state might be `None` when an item is being selected, the `Profile` class 
> must have either a parameter-less contructor, either a constructor that accepts only nullable parameters.

## Commands
The generated _view model_ of a _model_ will automatically re-expose as `ICommand` public methods that are compatible (cf. "general rules" below).

For instance, in your _model_:

```csharp
public async ValueTask Share() 
{

}
```

This will be exposed into an `ICommand` that can be data-bound to the `Command` property of a `Button`

```xml
<Button Command="{Binding Share}" 
        Content="Share" />
```

By default, if the method has a parameter `T myValue` and there is a property `Feed<T> MyValue` on the same class (matching type and name), that parameter will automatically be filled from that feed.

For instance, in your _model_:

```csharp
public IFeed<string> Message { get; }

public async ValueTask Share(string message) 
{

}
```

Can be used with or without any `CommandParameter` from the view:

```xml
<!-- Without CommandParameter -->
<!-- 'message' arg in the 'Share' method will be the current value of the Message _feed_ -->
<Button Command="{Binding Share}" 
        Content="Share" />

<!-- With CommandParameter -->
<!-- 'message' arg in the 'Share' method will be "hello world" -->
<Button Command="{Binding Share}" 
        CommandParameter="hello world" 
        Content="Share" />
```

You can also use both "feed parameters" and "view parameter" (i.e. the value of the `CommandParameter`):

```csharp
public IFeed<MyEntity> Entity { get; }

public async ValueTask Share(MyEntity entity, string origin) 
{
}
```

```xml
<Button Command="{Binding Share}" 
        CommandParameter="command_bar" 
        Content="Share" />
```

General rules for methods to be re-exposed as commands are:
* At most one paramater that cannot be resolved from a _Feed_  property in your VM (a.k.a the `CommandParameter`);
* At most one `CancellationToken`;
* Method can be sync, or async

> [!NOTE]
> The automatic parameters resolution be configured using attributes:
> - `[ImplicitFeedCommandParameters(is_enabled)]` on assembly or class to enable or disable the implicit parameters resolution.
> - `[FeedParameter("MyEntity")]` to explicit the property to use for a given parameter, e.g.
>      ```csharp
>      public IFeed<string> Message { get; }
>      
>      public async ValueTask Share([FeedParameter(nameof(Message))] string msg)
>      {
>      }
>      ```
