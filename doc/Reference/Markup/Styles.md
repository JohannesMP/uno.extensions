# Styles

Creating Styles with C# Markup is easy and intuitive using the `Style<T>` with extensions that let you easily set the value of a property the same as you might on a given control.

```cs
new Style<TextBlock>()
	.Setters(s => s.FontSize(14))
```

## Basing a Style on another Style

Sometimes you may want to base a style on another style. This can be done one of two ways. The first is that you can provide the name/key of the style. It is important to remember that this has a limitation of only working for globally accessible styles through the Application and is best used for default styles.

```cs
new Style<TextBlock>()
	.BasedOn("GlobalStyleResourceName")
```

The second way is to provide a `Style` instance.

```cs
new Style<TextBlock>()
	.Assign(out var baseStyle);

new Style<TextBlock>()
	.BasedOn(baseStyle)
```

## Using Resources for Style Setters

Sometimes you might want to use a Static or Theme resource on your style property. In these cases you can continue to use the Dependency Property Builder to set the value of the setter on a given property the same as you might when setting the value on a control instance.

```cs
// Static Resource
new Style<Button>()
	.Setters(s => s.Background(StaticResource.Get<Brush>("MyBrush")))

// Theme Resource
new Style<Button>()
	.Setters(s => s.Background(ThemeResource.Get<Brush>("MyBrush")))
```

Alternatively if you are using a Theme Resource from [Uno.Material](xref:uno.themes.material.getstarted), you can use [Uno.Themes.WinUI.Markup](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uno.Themes.WinUI.Markup) for a strongly typed API making it easier to both discover and make use of the various theme Styles, Colors and Brushes. Instead of calling `StaticResource.Get` or `ThemeResource.Get` you will simply use the Theme call to access the Color, Brush or Style.

```cs
new Style<Button>()
	.Setters(s => s.Background(Theme.Brushes.Primary.Default))
```

## Templates

You can similarly provide a template on a `Style` similar to how might

```cs
new Style<Button>()
	.Setters(setters => setters
		.Template(b => new Border()
			.Child(
				new ContentPresenter()
					.Content(x => x.TemplateBind(() => b.Content))
			)
		)
	)
```
